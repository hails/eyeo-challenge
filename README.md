## Case study

**A. Why is it, in general, necessary to scroll to the bottom of a page when capturing ads?**

_From what I understood, the ads are lazy-loaded based on where in the document it at the moment, scrolling down to very bottom will the loading  of the ads_

**B. From the perspective of eyeo, what (business) use case could the given script help to support (in the context of Acceptable Ads)?**

_I think this script could help when you want to know if there's a better place in the page where the ads could be._<br>
_Also utcould be used feed a possible machine-learning service with the current position of the ads of our partners_
